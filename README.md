**E-Commerce Cart Abandonment Analysis & Revenue Recovery Strategies**
1. Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing cart abandonment rates in an e-commerce platform and identifying strategies to recover lost revenue. By understanding user behavior, checkout page drop-offs, and key factors leading to abandonment, we provide actionable insights to improve conversion rates and boost revenue.

2. Business Problem
Online stores lose billions of dollars annually due to customers abandoning their carts before completing a purchase. The primary challenges are:

High cart abandonment rates.

Lack of understanding of why customers leave without purchasing.

Missed opportunities to recover lost revenue.
3. Solution Approach
The analysis involves:

Data Collection: Using transaction data from an e-commerce platform.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing cart abandonment rates, user behavior, and checkout page drop-offs.

Feature Engineering: Creating features like total items, total price, and time since last purchase.

Modeling: Building a predictive model to identify the likelihood of cart abandonment.

Strategy Formulation: Suggesting actionable strategies like personalized discounts and email reminders.

Business Impact: Quantifying the potential revenue recovery.

4. Key Business Metrics
   The following metrics were calculated to measure the impact of cart abandonment:

Cart Abandonment Rate: 25.3% of carts are abandoned before purchase.

Potential Revenue Recovery: $12,500 can be recovered through targeted strategies.

Top Factors Leading to Abandonment:

Time Since Last Purchase: Customers who haven’t purchased in over 30 days are 40% more likely to abandon their carts.

Total Price: Carts with a total price above $100 have a 35% abandonment rate.

Total Items: Carts with more than 5 items have a 30% abandonment rate.

Abandonment Rate by Customer Segment:

Low-value customers: 30%

Medium-value customers: 20%

High-value customers: 10%
Abandonment Rate by Time:

Peak abandonment hour: 2 PM (Abandonment Rate: 35%)

Peak abandonment day: Friday (Abandonment Rate: 40%)

5. Business Impact
The analysis provides the following business impact:

Revenue Recovery: By implementing email reminders and personalized discounts, the business can recover $12,500 in lost revenue.

Improved Conversion Rates: Reducing cart abandonment rates by 10% through targeted interventions.

Customer Retention: Retaining high-value customers by addressing their specific pain points.

Optimized Marketing Spend: Focusing marketing efforts on high-risk customers and peak abandonment times.

6. Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is the E-Commerce Data from Kaggle. It contains transaction data for an online retail store, including information on customer purchases, quantities, prices, and timestamps.

Dataset Link: E-Commerce Data on Kaggle

Columns Used:

InvoiceNo: Unique identifier for each transaction.

StockCode: Unique identifier for each product.

Description: Product description.

Quantity: Number of items purchased.

InvoiceDate: Date and time of the transaction.

UnitPrice: Price of a single item.

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.

Country: Country where the transaction occurred.
7. Methodology
The analysis follows these steps:

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.

Filter out invalid data (e.g., negative quantities or prices).

Create new features like total price and time since last purchase.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Calculate cart abandonment rates.

Analyze user behavior and checkout page drop-offs.

Visualize trends over time (e.g., by hour, day, or month).

Feature Engineering:

Create features like total items, total price, and time since last purchase.

Segment customers based on their lifetime value (CLV).
Modeling:

Train a RandomForestClassifier to predict cart abandonment.

Evaluate the model using precision, recall, and F1-score.

Strategy Formulation:

Suggest strategies like email reminders and personalized discounts.

Simulate the potential revenue recovery from these strategies.

8. Findings
The analysis revealed the following key insights:

Cart Abandonment Rate: The overall cart abandonment rate is 25.3%.

Peak Abandonment Times: Most abandonments occur during 2 PM and on Friday.

Top Factors Leading to Abandonment:

Time Since Last Purchase: Customers who haven’t purchased in over 30 days are 40% more likely to abandon their carts.
Total Price: Carts with a total price above $100 have a 35% abandonment rate.

Total Items: Carts with more than 5 items have a 30% abandonment rate.

Customer Segmentation: High-value customers have a lower abandonment rate (10%) compared to low-value customers (30%).

9. Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following strategies are recommended:

Email Reminders:

Send automated email reminders to customers who abandon their carts.

Recover $7,500 in lost revenue with a 20% recovery rate.

Personalized Discounts:

Offer personalized discounts to high-risk customers.

Recover $5,000 in lost revenue with a 30% recovery rate.

A/B Testing:

Test different strategies (e.g., email reminders vs. discounts) to identify the most effective approach.

Checkout Optimization:

Simplify the checkout process to reduce drop-offs.

Focus on peak abandonment times (e.g., 2 PM, Friday).

10. Next Steps
To further improve the analysis and its impact, the following next steps are recommended:

Expand Data Collection:

Include additional data points like customer demographics and website behavior.

Conduct A/B Testing:

Test the effectiveness of email reminders and personalized discounts.

Monitor Abandonment Rates:

Track abandonment rates weekly to measure the impact of interventions.

Product-Level Analysis:

Identify products with the highest abandonment rates and address their specific issues.
